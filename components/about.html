                <p>
                    I am a passionate Computer Science student with a strong foundation in software development,
                    competitive programming, and full stack engineering. My journey in tech began with a fascination for
                    building functional, real-time applications that solve real-world problems, which has led me to
                    develop projects like ChatApp, SendRetrieve, and AI-platforms using technologies such as Node.js,
                    React, and MongoDB.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Currently, I'm pursuing my B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering at CMR Institute of
                    Technology, Hyderabad, and preparing for a 3-month internship at Enzen Global Solutions, where I’ve
                    also secured a full-time offer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Beyond academics and development, I actively contribute to the open-source community as a GSSoC 2025
                    contributor and enjoy working on meaningful, collaborative projects. I’m particularly interested in
                    backend architecture, real-time communication systems.
